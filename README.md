# FlashCardsIO

### Project Overview
FlashCardsIO is a React Native mobile application (Android and iOS) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "Decks" and add flashcards to those them. Finally, it will give the ability to take quizzes on those decks. Quizzes are randomly every time and stats are saved for users' records.

### Why this project?
This project is part of the React Nanodegree Program by Udacity. This project encompasses the fundamental aspects of building a native application including handling infinite lists, routing, and user input. By building this project, I have gained an understanding of how to user React Native to build an Android and iOS application.
